### Hello there, I'm Zewu 💪🏼

I'm a 24-year-old developer living in Brazil and passionate about learn new things, such new languages or tools.<br>
Currently I'm Senior iOS Engineer at C6 Bank, allocated in fraud prevention squad. My focus is guarantee security at banking transactions, dealing with login, lifeproof, device management and other things. The security part in a project is my favourite part.<br>
I work with a large and scalable project, aiming for quality rather than quantity, participating in all stages of the project from conception to development and observability. In addition to development, I worked on mobile accessibility and FinOps initiatives.<br>
My english level is intermediate (B1) and I'm trying to improve every day.<br>
Lately, I've been working in personal projects, so the GitHub won't show my contributions.
